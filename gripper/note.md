    Based on the mobility of the robotic grippers, exists three main categories that classify the design of the grippers:
    - Completely constrained.
    - Underconstrained.
    - Deformable.

## 1. Completely contrained

<div align = "justify">
    <p>
        Completely constrained finger mechanisms are devices with a DOF equivalent to their number of actuators, which allows the trajectory of the tip of the finger to follow a predefined path. Note that the number of DOF is computed using the Gruebler-Kutzbach:

<blockquote>
    <div align = "center">
        <p>M = 3L - 2J</p>
    </div>
</blockquote>
<div align = "justify">
    <p>
        Where:
        <li>M: the total DOF</li>
        <li>L: The number of the links</li>
        <li>J: The number of the joints</li>
    </p>
</div>
